# rev.now

Christianity is very simple. We enter into a relationship with God through
Jesus Christ. We enter into God by loving them with all our heart, mind, soul,
and strength. And God enters into us by loving our neighbors as ourselves.
Treating them as Jesus would treat them.

This is the essence of Christianity and the mission of rev.now.

# Revelation: God is Love

Here's the revelation, **God is love**. God's love for us is perfect,
unconditional, and immeasurable. He loves you right now, as you read this. This
page is an expression of God's love for you through the author writing it.

> Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. **[1 John 4:8](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1John4:8&version=ESV)**

Reflect on this: God's love is the foundation of our faith and the guiding principle of our lives.

# Revolution: Love God, love others

A revolution within ourselves begins the moment the Holy Spirit of God touches us. We may resist it, we may try to reason about it, but irresistibly it reaches out again and again.

Jesus was asked what is the greatest commandment...

> And he answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and
> with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind,
> and your neighbor as yourself." **[Luke 10:27](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke10:27&version=ESV)**

It's all about love. Love God, love people.

# Revival: Spread God's love

God wants us to feel his love. We do that by loving others as ourselves. We are
all children of God, called to walk in faith, hope, and love.

> So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. **[1 Corinthians 13:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Corinthians13:13&version=ESV)**
